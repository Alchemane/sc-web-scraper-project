this project is a novice coders work, it is by no means perfect. a project i decided to do because i really wanted to archive my songs but online converters could not do the job for an entire playlist or liked page. written in python and makes use of python libraries such as selenium, bs4 and pyside6, it uses a chrome browser instance to simulate your soundcloud liked page to load all dynamic elements and scrape and download your liked songs straight to your computer. this tool can scrape and download songs from either your liked track page, an album playlist, or a user created playlist. if you hate soundcloud artists always privating and deleting their songs, archive them. im sure you fellow data hoarders will like this one. exe is in dist. not sure why there is a random command prompt that comes when running the exe but i guess its a feature now. the project does not contain any malware. i have no reason to do so and if you do not trust this, run it in a vm, or scan it using an antivirus software. the code is completely open source feel free to take a look. feedback is welcome, but im not sure if i will update it as it does as i need it to, download my liked tracks to my computer. thanks
